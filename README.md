# Photometric_Redshift
Estimate the Redshift of galaxies using Decision Tree model.
The redshift of galaxies can be predicted by using the light intensity values emitted by them in the following wavelength ranges :<br>

1. Ultraviolet (u)
2. Green (g)
3. Red (r)
4. Near Infrared (i)
5. Infrared (z)
<br>
A decision tree regressor is trained on the difference of the intensity values through each filter , to obtain a decent estimate of the Redshift.
